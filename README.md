# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- # [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
  
# To start a project with vite + react
- clone the repository
- run "npm install" to install the dependencies for the React Project
- run npm run dev to open a localhost server.

# Notable Features
Explore an extensive array of movies sourced from TMDb.
Access comprehensive movie details including titles, release dates, synopses, and user ratings.
